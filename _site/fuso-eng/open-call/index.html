        <h3>RESILIENCE. HOPE. COMMUNITY.</h3><p><br></p><h5>We live amidst speculative discussions about the post-pandemic era, wondering what it could be like. There is a tension between order and rupture, that is reflected in the art production.</h5><h5>The role of art is to foster a meaningful dialogue on the important social, political and environmental challenges that confront our world today. Race and class conflicts, the climate emergency and the pandemic caused by COVID-19 are crises in a planetary dimension that artists of our time are exploring. How might we create new knowledge and leverage it as a tool for critical reflection and, ultimately, collective change?</h5><h5>In 2022, FUSO wants to highlight the possibility of the existence of art as a gesture of resilience and hope</h5><p></p><p><br>OPEN CALL <br>for all Portuguese artists and foreign artists living in Portugal</p><p></p><p>REGULATIONS<br>Applications from the 20th of May to the 30th of June, 2022</p><p></p><p>GENERAL CONDITIONS</p><p>A jury, presided over by Margarida Chantre, will select the best video.</p><p>The previous selection of videos in the running will be the responsibility of Jean-François Chougnet.</p><p>In 2022, the EDP/MAAT Foundation maintains its partnership with the Open Call | FUSO - Lisbon International Video Art Festival, through its granting of the EDP/MAAT Foundation Acquisition Award for the jury’s selection of the best work, in the amount of 2.500€.</p><p>The public will also be invited to vote on pre-selected videos at a public session at the MAAT – Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology’s garden on the 24th of August, 2022*.
